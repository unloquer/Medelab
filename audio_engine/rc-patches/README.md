### Current

The current rc lib is moving towards a pd-vanilla / rjlib focus in order for the majority of patches to work in libpd.

You will need to have the [rjlib](https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib) installed and added to your path. Get it from here: https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib

**rc**: the new robotcowboy lib, following the rjlib model

**rc-patches**: robotcowboy patch library (to be slowly rewritten into the rc lib)

**gm-patches**: general midi helpers (to be rewritten into the rc lib)

**rc-drums**: 808 drum emulation (to be rewritten into the rc lib)

**extra**: patches which require externals (aka pd-extended)

### Old (deprecated)

These will either be removed or rewritten and added to other folders.

**wip-patches**: bleeding edge work in progress patches (to be moved)
